## Emojis
```markdown
Sometimes you want to :monkey: around a bit and add some :star2: to your
:speech_balloon:. Well we have a gift for you: :zap: You can use emoji
anywhere GFM is supported.

:v: You can use it to point out a :bug: or warn about :speak_no_evil: patches.

And if someone improves your really :snail: code, send them some :birthday:.

People will :heart: you for that. If you are new to this, don't be :fearful:.
You can easily join the emoji :family:. All you need to do is to look up one
of the supported codes.

Consult the [Emoji Cheat Sheet](https://www.emojicopy.com) for a list of all
supported emoji codes. :thumbsup: Most emoji are natively supported on macOS,
Windows, iOS, Android and will fallback to image-based emoji where there is
lack of support.

On Linux, you can download [Noto Color Emoji](https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/emoji/)
to get full native emoji support.

Ubuntu 18.04 (like many modern Linux distros) has this font installed by
default.
