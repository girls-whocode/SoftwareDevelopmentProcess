## Links
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., \[Google\]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., \(https://google.com\)).

```markdown
My favorite search engine is [Google](https://google.com).
```

The rendered output looks like this:

My favorite search engine is [Google](https://google.com).

## Adding Titles
You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in parentheses after the URL.

```markdown
My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").
```

The rendered output looks like this:

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").

## URLs and Email Addresses
To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.

```markdown
<https://www.markdownguide.org>
<fake@example.com>
```
