## Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, add a \> in front of a paragraph.

> Here is an example of a blockquote, also good for making notes stand out! Other **styling** may be *applied* here as well

## Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a \> on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

```markdown
> One bright day in the middle of the night
>
> Two dead boys got up to fight
>
> Back to back they faced each other...
```

This is what it will look like:

> One bright day in the middle of the night
>
> Two dead boys got up to fight
>
> Back to back they faced each other...

#### Alternative Method

```markdown
>>>
You can place multiple lines of text

inside the block of >>>

for the same effect.
>>>
```

The rendered output would look like this:
>>>

inside the block of >>>

for the same effect.

## Nested Blockquotes

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work.

```markdown
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

## Blockquotes with Other Elements

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work.

```markdown
> ### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
> *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

> ### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
> *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
