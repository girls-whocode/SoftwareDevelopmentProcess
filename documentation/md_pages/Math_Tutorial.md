## Math
It is possible to have math written with the LaTeX syntax rendered using KaTeX. Math written inside $``$ will be rendered inline with the text. Math written inside triple back quotes, with the language declared as math, will be rendered on a separate line.

```markdown
This math is inline $`a^2+b^2=c^2`$.
```

The rendered output looks like this:
This math is inline $a^2+b^2=c^2$.
