Give examples, use within ` (tick characters)
```

Employ some really cool looking code!

```javascript
  const requireComponent = require.context(
    // Look for files in the current directory
    '.',
    // Do not look in subdirectories
    false,
    // Only include "_base-" prefixed .vue files
    /_base-[\w-]+\.vue$/
  )
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```sh
# Give the example, you can even use terminal code styling of your choice
foo@bar:~$ sudo make ./makefile
```

```dos
# Here is a DOS example
C:\> make ./makefile
```

And repeat

```markdown
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
