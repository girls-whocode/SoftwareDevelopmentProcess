This repository was created for enterprise level software development processes. Its primary functions are:

1. Build easy to read, develop, and maintain code.
   1. MVC and MVVM styles
   2. Web based styles
   3. Cross platform styles
2. Create great documentation.
   1. Extensive GFM [Markdown](markdown) and Kramdown Languages.
   2. Word processing and PDF user documents.
   3. HTML and online user documents.
3. Properly use a repository
   1. [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com)
   2. [GitHub](https://www.github.com)

## Building Easy to read and maintain code

Create a standards of code policy, by using ECMA Script, .NET, Ruby, Rails, and even HTML Standards that are currently in public use. Most high level schooling will use these standards in their studies, which will allow new employees to pick up and start work right away. Review the Coding Standards below to understand how these may be applied to the environment.

## Documentation

If your documentation is out of date, or hard to read, or even non-existent. Then not only does it make it extremely more difficult for other developers to assist you, but if many months, or even years have gone by, you will have to relearn your entire code.

This is where proper documentation assists with all of these issues. Below are great resources that I have put together to help software developers build great documents for others to jump right in and start assisting with your project.

## Quick Start

This is a read-only document project, no other software or specialized settings are required to navigate through these documents.
